# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview of Project

For this Project we used JavaScript and Plotly to display a dashboard that shows the found bacteria in a personâ€™s belly button, this information is contained in a dataset from which we created three different charts: a bar chart that shows the top ten bacteria cultures found, a bubble chart with bacteria cultures per sample and a gauge with the number of times a person wash their belly button per week.

Also, we can select the test subject by the id number that we want to check and display their demographic information.

## Results

The webpage shows the information as we can see it in the image below:

In the next image we can see where we can select the test subject id number and see the demographic information:

## Summary

We used our knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly and HTML to develop a dashboard displayed in a webpage to facilitate researchers visualize the data about the bacteria found in a belly button.
